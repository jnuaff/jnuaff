### Hola 👋

I'm a self-taught frontend developer currently undergoing an apprenticeship at [3pc](https://3pc.de/). I'm focused on creating clean and semantic web applications following accessibility standards. I care about accessible design and development, learn from my teammates, and keep up to date trying new technologies. I'm also passionate about music 🎹, cooking 🍝, and analog photography 📸.
